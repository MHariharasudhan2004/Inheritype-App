## üìã About The Project

**Inheritype** is an Android app built with Java that provides a simple, user-friendly interface to:
* Predict the possible ABO and Rh blood types of a child.
* Get a list of interesting facts related to the predicted blood groups.
* Save all predictions to a local database to view later in a history log.

This project was built as a way to learn Android development, including UI design with Material Components, local database management with SQLite, and multi-activity app architecture.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Blood Group Prediction:** Select the ABO/Rh types for two parents and get an instant list of possible child blood types.
* **Optional Naming:** Add a name to your prediction to easily identify it later.
* **Prediction History:** A numbered list of all past predictions, which can be cleared at any time.
* **Fact of the Day:** The home screen shows a random, interesting fact about blood types.
* **Blood Group Facts:** The results page shows relevant facts about the predicted blood groups.
* **Clean UI:** A modern, trust-inspiring blue color scheme built with Material Design.
